# Hello! I'm Jan :wave:

I am a full-stack developer, for now I specialize in creating interactive web applications and implementing software infrastructures. My main focus is on developing attractive and functional user interfaces on the front-end. While I also have some basic knowledge in Backend, my main focus is on creating exceptional user experiences and optimizing development and deployment processes.
